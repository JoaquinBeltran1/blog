Hi, **Main idea**.

The main idea of _this project_ is to go through all necessary steps to do a complete analysis of some realistic business data. [Link text Here](https://link-url-here.org)

I’ll generate the data using Python in Jupyter Notebooks. The objective here is to create a somewhat realistic, and above all consistent data, that follows some set trends plus some randomness (both in individual values and the trend itself).

So for example: ....

About the data

- Located in different files
- Some will be in realtional tables
- Some  in excel-csv files
- Rough numbers: 5000 paid customers, 100000 have tried free demo. In Excel
- An avg of emails (could be 0, unlikely) per either contact or company. Received, opened, answered.
- An avg of calls per company (assigned to contacts)
- An avg of meets given companyoutcome. If company becomes client, has to have a minimum of 3 meets (1 discovery, 2 signing, 3 implementation)

About the storage of the data

Let’s start creating data!
