<script>
let numbers = 21
</script>

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello World");
};
```

Trying svelte in MD. Show the number: {numbers}

```python
# Solve the quadratic equation ax**2 + bx + c = 0

# import complex math module
import cmath

a = 1
b = 5
c = 6

# calculate the discriminant
d = (b**2) - (4*a*c)

# find two solutions
sol1 = (-b-cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)
sol2 = (-b+cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)

print('The solution are {0} and {1}'.format(sol1,sol2))
```

```php
class Dog extends Pet
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $name,
        public bool $isGoodBoy,
        public bool $isHappy
    ) {};

    public function pat(): void
    {
        $this->isHappy = true;
    }
}
```

Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]

[^1]: This is the first footnote.

[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.

    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.

    ```
    my code

    Add as many paragraphs as you like.

Hi, **Main idea**.

The main idea of _this project_ is to go through all necessary steps to do a complete analysis of some realistic business data. [Link text Here](https://link-url-here.org)

I’ll generate the data using Python in Jupyter Notebooks. The objective here is to create a somewhat realistic, and above all consistent data, that follows some set trends plus some randomness (both in individual values and the trend itself).

So for example: ....

About the data

- Located in different files
- Some will be in realtional tables
- Some  in excel-csv files
- Rough numbers: 5000 paid customers, 100000 have tried free demo. In Excel
- An avg of emails (could be 0, unlikely) per either contact or company. Received, opened, answered.
- An avg of calls per company (assigned to contacts)
- An avg of meets given companyoutcome. If company becomes client, has to have a minimum of 3 meets (1 discovery, 2 signing, 3 implementation)

About the storage of the data

Let’s start creating data!

Setting up the environment
